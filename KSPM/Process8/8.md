# Evaluate

This phase manages the evaluation of a specific instance of a statistical business process, as opposed to the more general overarching process of statistical quality management described in Section VI (Overarching Processes). It can take place at the end of the instance of the process, but can also be done on an ongoing basis during the statistical production process. It relies on inputs gathered throughout the different phases. It includes evaluating the success or failure of a specific instance of the statistical business process, drawing on a range of quantitative and qualitative inputs, and identifying and prioritising potential improvements in efficiency and quality, which are then either fed into the next phase or considered during the next iteration for products produced regularly.

For statistical outputs produced regularly, evaluation should, at least in theory, occur for each iteration, determining whether future iterations should take place, and if so, whether any improvements should be implemented. However, in some cases, particularly for regular and well-established statistical business processes, evaluation might not be formally carried out for each iteration. In such cases, this phase can be seen as providing the decision as to whether the next iteration should start from the **Specify Needs** phase, or from some later phase (often the **Collect** phase).

The **“Evaluate”** phase is broken down into three sub-processes which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative
