# Conduct evaluation

This sub-process analyses the evaluation inputs compares them to the expected/target benchmarking results (when available), and process them into an evaluation report or control dashboard. The evaluation can take place at the end of the whole process (End-line Evaluation) for selected activities, during its execution in a continuous way (mid-line evaluation), or throughout the process (continuous evaluation), thus allowing for quick fixes or continuous improvement. The resulting report should note any quality issues specific to this iteration of the statistical business process as well as highlight any deviation of performance metrics from expected values, and should make recommendations for changes if necessary. These recommendations can cover changes to any phase or sub-process for future iterations of the process, or can suggest that the process is not repeated. In the case of determined need of changes in the business process, a list of recommendations with proper justifications should be developed.
