# Gather evaluation inputs

Evaluation material can be produced in any other phase or sub-process. It may take many forms, including feedback from users, process metadata (paradata), system metrics, and staff suggestions. Reports of progress against an action plan agreed during a previous iteration may also form an input to evaluations of subsequent iterations. This sub-process gathers all of these inputs, compiles quality indicators and makes them available for the person or team conducting the evaluation. The collection of some of these evaluation materials can be automated and take place in a continuous way throughout the whole process, as defined by the quality framework (see Quality Management in Section VI). On the other hand, for the evaluation of certain processes it can be necessary to perform specific activities such as small surveys, (e.g. post-enumeration surveys, re-interview studies, survey on the effectiveness of dissemination).
