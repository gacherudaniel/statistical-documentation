# Agree on an action plan

This sub-process brings together the necessary decision-making power to form and agree on an action plan based on the evaluation report. It should also include consideration of a mechanism for monitoring the impact of those actions, which may, in turn, provide input to evaluations of future iterations of the process.

## Input

- Evaluation report
- Final product report
- Proposal on improvement

## Output
