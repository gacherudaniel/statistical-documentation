# Update output systems

This sub-process manages the update of systems (e.g. databases, server space and websites) where data and metadata are stored ready for dissemination purposes, including:

- Formatting data and metadata ready to be put into output systems;
- Loading data and metadata into output systems;
- Ensuring data are linked to the relevant metadata.

Formatting, loading and linking of metadata should preferably mostly take place in earlier phases, but this sub-process includes a final check that all of the necessary metadata are in place and ready for dissemination.
