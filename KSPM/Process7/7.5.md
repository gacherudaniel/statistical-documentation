# Manage user support

This sub-process ensures that user queries and requests for services such as microdata access are recorded, and that responses are provided within the stipulated timeframe. These queries and requests should be regularly reviewed to provide input to the overarching quality management process, as they can indicate new or changing user needs. Replies to user requests can also be used to populate a knowledge database or a**Frequently Asked Question** page, that is made publicly available, thus reducing the burden of replying to repeated and/or similar requests from external users. This sub-process also includes managing support to any partner organisations involved in disseminating the products. This sub-process also entails training stakeholders and media on reading and interpreting results of the produced products including its uses to avoid misuse.
