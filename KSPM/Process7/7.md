# Disseminate

This phase manages the release of the statistical products to users. It includes all activities associated with assembling and releasing a range of static and dynamic products via a range of channels such as publications, press releases, and websites among others. These activities support users to access and use the products released by the statistical organisation. For statistical products produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration.

The **“Disseminate”** phase is broken down into five sub-processes which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative

- [7.1 Update output systems](7.1.md)
- [7.2 Produce dissemination products](7.2.md)
- [7.3 Manage release of dissemination products](7.3.md)
- [7.4 Promote dissemination products](7.4.md)
- [7.5 Manage user support](7.5.md)
