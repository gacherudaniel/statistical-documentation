# 3 Build

This phase builds and tests the production solution to the point where it is ready for use in the "live" environment. The outputs of the "Design" phase are assembled and configured in this phase to create the complete operational environment to run the process. New services are built by exception, created in response to gaps in the existing catalogue of services sourced from within the organisation and externally. These new services are constructed to be broadly reusable in alignment with the business architecture of the organisation where possible.

For statistical outputs produced on a regular basis, this phase usually occurs for the first iteration, following a review or a change in methodology or technology, rather than for every iteration. The phase is broken down into seven sub-processes , which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative.
