# 3.5 Test production systems

This sub-process is concerned with the testing of assembled and configured services and related workflows. It includes technical testing and sign-off of new programmes and routines, as well as confirmation that existing routines from other statistical business processes are suitable for use in this case. Whilst part of this activity concerning the testing of individual components and services could logically be linked with sub-process [3.1](3.1.md), [3.2](3.2.md) and [3.3](3.3.md), this sub-process also includes testing of interactions between assembled and configured services and ensuring that the whole production solution works coherently.
