# 3.4 Configure workflows

This sub-process configures the workflow, systems and transformations used within the 
business processes, from data collection to dissemination. In this sub-process, the workflow is configured based on the design created in sub-process 2.6 (Design production systems and workflows). This could include modifying a standardized workflow for a specific purpose, assembling the workflows for the different phases (possibly with a workflow/business process management system) and configuring systems accordingly
