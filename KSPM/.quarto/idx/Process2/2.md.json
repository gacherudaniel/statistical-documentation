{"title":"2 Design","markdown":{"headingText":"2 Design","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"![Phase](../Assets/images/Design%20Phase.png)\n\n\nThis phase describes the development and design activities, and any associated practical research work needed to define the statistical outputs, concepts, methodologies, collection instruments and operational processes. It includes all the design elements needed to define or refine the statistical products or services identified in the business case. It also specifies all relevant metadata, ready for use later in the business process, as well as quality assurance procedures. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase usually occurs for the first iteration and whenever improvement actions are identified in the “Evaluate” phase of a previous iteration.\n\nDesign activities make substantial use of international and national standards to reduce the length and cost of the design process and enhance the comparability and usability of outputs. Organisations are encouraged to reuse or adapt design elements from existing processes and to consider geospatial aspects of data in the design to enhance the usability and value of the statistical information. Additionally, the outputs of design processes may form the basis for future standards at the organisational, national or international levels.\n\nThe **“Design”** phase is broken down into six sub-processes which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative.\n\n- [2.1 Design outputs](2.1.md)\n- [2.2 Design variable descriptions](2.2.md)\n- [2.3 Design collection](2.3.md)\n- [2.4 Design frame and sample](2.4.md)\n- [2.5 Design processing and analysis](2.5.md)\n- [2.6 Design production systems and workflow](2.6.md)\n\n<button onclick=\"history.back()\">Go Back</button>\n\n[Go to Home
