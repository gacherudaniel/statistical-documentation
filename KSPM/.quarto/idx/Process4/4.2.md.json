{"title":"4.2 Set up collection","markdown":{"headingText":"4.2 Set up collection","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis sub-process ensures that the data collection personel, processes and technology (e.g. web-based applications, GPS) are ready to collect data and metadata, in all modes as designed. It takes place over a period of time, as it includes the strategy, planning and training activities in preparation for the specific instance of the statistical business process. Where the process is repeated regularly, some (or all) of these activities may not be explicitly required for each iteration. For one-off and new processes, these activities can be lengthy. For survey data, this sub-process includes:\n\n## Survey sources\n\n- Preparing a collection strategy;\n- Providing information for respondents (e.g. drafting letters or brochures explaining the purpose of the survey, notifying respondents when online reporting instruments will be made available);\n- Translating of materials (e.g. into the different languages spoken or used in the country).\n- Preparing collection instruments (e.g. printing questionnaires, pre-filling them with existing data, loading questionnaires and data onto interviewers' computers, APIs, web scraping tools);\n- Ensuring collection resources are available (e.g. laptops, tablets, collection apps, APIs);\n- Configuring collection systems to request and receive the data;\n- Ensuring the security of data to be collected;\n- Identify personnel (e.g. from within organization or recruiting incl interpreter and etc);\n- Training collection staff;\n- Agreeing on terms with any service providers;\n- Training system using appropriate technology e.g. using supervised machine learning techniques, webinar; Agreeing on terms with any intermediate collection bodies, (e.g. sub-contractors for computer assisted telephone interviewing, web services);\n\n## Non-survey sources\n\n- For non-survey sources, this sub-process ensures that the necessary personnel, processes, systems and confidentiality procedures are in place, to receive or extract the necessary information from the source. This includes:\n  - Evaluating requests to acquire the data and logging the request in a centralised inventory;\n  - Initiating contacts with organisations providing the data, and sending an introductory package with details on the process of acquiring the data;\n  - Checking detailed information about files and metadata with the data provider and receiving a test file to assess if data are fit for use;\n  - Arranging secure channels for the transmission of the data.\n\n## Input\n\n- Collection staff availability\n- Training staff\n- Training\n- Questionnaires\n- publicity and advocacy materials i.e. adverts, brochures\n- Vehicles\n- CAPI devices\n- Sub-process 3.6\n\n## Output\n\n- Trained staff\n- Printed/uploaded questionnaires\n- Data collection strategy\n- Dashboard\n- Informed respondents\n- Data collection instruments (e.g. Manuals, questionaires, CAPI, server)\n\n## Documentation and Tools\n\n- Training manuals\n- IEC material\n- Application manuals\n- HR Guidelines on recruitment\n- Template for contracts for service providers\n- ICT documentation (e.g. how to set up and use)\n- Logistical guidelines (e.g. storage, distribution and return of tablets)
