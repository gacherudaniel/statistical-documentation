# Generic Statistical Business Process Model

Generic Statistical Business Process Model [(GSBPM)](https://unece.org/statistics/modernstats/gsbpm) is a Set of pre-defined processes, set together to reflect the entire statistical production. It was first developed in 2008 by a collaboration between United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)/Eurostat/Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) through the High Level Group for the Modernisation of Official Statistics (HLG-MOS). The Current version 5.1 was released in 2019.

The generic framework is applicable to a wide range of statistical activities and therefore statistical organizations can customize the model to align with their specific needs, priorities, and constraints. The generic framework has been customized to the Kenyan context through tailoring the processes, methodologies, and tools outlined in the GSBPM to accommodate specific data requirements, legal frameworks, cultural considerations, and resource constraints.

KNBS welcomes all producers of statistics to adopt this framework as a standard guide in the statistical production process.
