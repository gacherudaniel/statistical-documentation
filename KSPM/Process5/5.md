# Process

This phase describes the processing of collected data and their preparation for analysis. It is made up of eight sub-processes that integrate, classify, check, clean, and transform collected data, so that they can be analysed and disseminated as statistical outputs. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration. The sub-processes in this phase can apply to data from both statistical and non-statistical sources (with the possible exception of sub-process [5.6](5.6.md), which is usually specific to survey data).

The "Process" and "Analyse" phases can be iterative and parallel. Analysis can reveal a broader understanding of the data, which might make it apparent that additional processing is needed. Sometimes the estimates being processed might be already published aggregates (undertaken according to a Revision Policy).

Activities within the **"Process"** and **"Analyse"** phases may also commence before the **"Collect"** phase is completed. This enables the verification of the quality of the data collected and compilation of provisional results where timeliness is an important concern for users, and increases the time available for analysis.

The **Process** phase is broken down into eight sub-processes , which may be sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative.
