# Calculate weights

This sub-process creates weights for unit data records according to the methodology developed in [sub-process 2.5](../Process2/2.5.md). For example, weights can be used to "gross-up" data to make them representative of the target population (e.g. for sample surveys or extracts of scanner data) or to adjust for non-response in total enumerations. In other situations, variables may need weighting for normalisation purposes. It may also include weight correction for benchmarking indicators (e.g. known population totals).
