# Review and validate

This sub-process examines integrated data to identify potential inconsistencies, errors and discrepancies such as outliers, item non-response and miscoding. It can also be referred to as data validation. It may be run iteratively, validating data against pre-defined edit rules, usually in a set order. It may flag data for automatic or manual inspection or editing. Reviewing and validating can apply to data from any type of source, before and after integration, as well as imputed data from sub-process 5.4 (Edit and impute). Whilst validation is treated as part of the **Process** phase, in practice, some elements of validation may occur alongside collection activities, particularly for modes such as computer-assisted collection. Whilst this sub-process is concerned with the detection and localisation of actual or potential errors, any correction activities that change the data are done in sub-process [5.4](5.4.md).
