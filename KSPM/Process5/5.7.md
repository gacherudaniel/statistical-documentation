# Calculate aggregates, estimates and errors

This sub-process creates aggregate data and population totals from microdata or lower-level aggregates. It includes summing data for records sharing certain characteristics (e.g. aggregation of data by demographic or geographic classifications), determining measures of central tendencies and applying weights from sub-process 5.6 (Calculate weights) to derive appropriate totals. In the case of statistical outputs which use sample surveys, sampling errors corresponding to relevant aggregates may also be calculated in this sub-process. For example, for sample surveys and censuses it entails development of tabulation plans and running initial tables based on the tabulation plans. Initial tables are used to determine errors based on the aggregates and any identified errors are corrected through sub-process 5.4 (Edit and impute).
