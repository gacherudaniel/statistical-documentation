# Finalise data files

35.This sub-process brings together the results of the other sub-processes in this phase in a data file (usually macro-data), which is used as the input to the [Analyse phase](../Process6/6.md). Sometimes this may be an intermediate rather than a final file, particularly for business processes where there are strong time pressures, and a requirement to produce both preliminary and final estimates.
