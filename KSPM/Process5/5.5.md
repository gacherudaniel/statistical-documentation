# Derive new variables and units

This sub-process produces variables and statistical units which are not available in the collected data but are needed to deliver the required outputs. It derives new variables by applying arithmetic formulae to one or more of the variables that are already present in the dataset, or applying different model assumptions. This activity may need to be iterative, as some derived variables may themselves be based on other derived variables. It is therefore important to ensure that variables are derived in the correct order. New variables may be derived by aggregating or splitting data from the collection units, or by various other estimation methods.
