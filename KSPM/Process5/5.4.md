Where data are considered incorrect, missing, unreliable or outdated, new values may be inserted or outdated data may be removed in this sub-process. The terms editing and imputation cover a variety of methods often using a rule-based approach. Specific steps typically include:

- Selecting the method to be used;
- Determining whether to add or change data;
- Adding/changing data values;
- Writing the new data values back to the data set, and flagging them as changed;
- Producing metadata on the editing and imputation process
