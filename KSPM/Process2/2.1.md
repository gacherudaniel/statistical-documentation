# 2.1 Design outputs

This sub-process contains the detailed design of the statistical outputs, products and services to be produced. It also includes the related development work and preparation of the systems and tools used in the **"Disseminate"** phase. Processes governing access to any confidential outputs are also designed here. Outputs should be designed to follow existing standards wherever possible, so inputs to this process may include metadata from similar or previous collections (including extractions from statistical, administrative, geospatial and other non-statistical registers and databases), international standards, and information about practices in other statistical organisations from sub-process [1.1](../Process1/1.1.md),  Outputs may also be designed in partnership with other interested bodies, particularly if they are considered to be joint outputs, or they will be disseminated by another organisation.
