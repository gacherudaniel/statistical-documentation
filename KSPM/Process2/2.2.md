# 2.2 Design variable descriptions

This sub-process defines the variables to be collected via the collection instrument, as well as any other variables that will be derived from them in sub-process [5.5](../Process5/5.5.md), and any statistical or geospatial classifications that will be used. It is expected that existing national and international standards will be followed wherever possible. This sub-process may need to run in parallel with sub-process [2.3](2.3.md) , as the definition of the variables to be collected, and the choice of collection instruments may be interdependent to some degree. Preparation of metadata descriptions of collected and derived variables, and statistical and geospatial classification is a necessary precondition for subsequent phases.
