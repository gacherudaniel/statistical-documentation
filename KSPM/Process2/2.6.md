# 2.6 Design production systems and workflow

This sub-process determines the workflow from data collection to dissemination, taking an overview of all the processes required within the whole production process and ensuring that they fit together efficiently with no gaps or redundancies. Various systems and databases are needed throughout the process. The GSBPM can be used as the basis of the business architecture layer when a statistical organisation has an existing enterprise architecture in place. The design might be adjusted to fit the organization. A general principle is to reuse processes and technology across many statistical business processes, so existing production solutions (e.g. services, systems and databases) should be examined first, to determine whether they are fit for purpose for this specific production process, then, if any gaps are identified, new solutions should be designed. It also considers how staff will interact with systems and who will be responsible for what and when.
