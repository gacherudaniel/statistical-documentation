# 4 Collect

This phase collects or gathers all necessary information (e.g. data, metadata and paradata), using different collection modes (e.g. acquisition, collection, extraction, transfer), and loads them into the appropriate platform (e.g. local server, cloud) for further processing.

Whilst it can include validation of data set formats, it does not include any transformations of the data themselves, as these are all done in the "Process" phase, except for transforming into the correct data collection valraiables. For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in each iteration.

The **“Collect”** phase is broken down into four sub-processes which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative
