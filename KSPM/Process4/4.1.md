# 4.1 Create frame and select sample

## Process

This sub-process creates or updates the frame (e.g. statistical business, household) and selects the sample for this iteration of the collection, as specified in sub-process 2.4 (Design frame and sample).
It also includes the coordination of samples between instances of the same statistical process (e.g. to manage overlap or rotation), and between different processes using a common frame or register (e.g. to manage overlap or to spread response burden).
Quality assurance and approval of the frame and the selected sample are also undertaken in this sub-process, though maintenance of underlying registers, from which frames for several statistical business processes are drawn, is treated as a separate statistical process.
The sampling aspect of this sub-process is not usually relevant for processes based entirely on the use of pre-existing sources (e.g. administrative registers, web sites) as such processes generally create frames from the availablae data and then follow a census approach.
Variables from administrative and other non-statistical sources of data can be used as auxiliary variables in the construction of sampling frame.
