# 1 Specify needs

This phase is triggered when a need for new statistics is identified or feedback about current statistics initiates a review. It includes all activities associated with engaging stakeholders to identify their detailed statistical needs (current or future), proposing high level solution options and preparing a business case to meet these needs.

The **“Specify Needs”** phase is broken down into six sub-processes which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative

- [1.1 Identify needs](1.1.md)
- [1.2 Consult and confirm needs](1.2.md)
- [1.3 Establish output objectives](1.3.md)
- [1.4 Identify concepts](1.4.md)
- [1.5 Check data avaialability](1.5.md)
- [1.6 Prepare and submit business case](1.6.md)
