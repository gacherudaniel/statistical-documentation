# 1.2 Consult and confirm needs

This sub-process focuses on consulting with the internal and external stakeholders and confirming in detail their statistical needs. A good understanding of user needs is required so that Producers know not only what it is expected to deliver, but also when, how, and, perhaps most importantly, why. For the second and subsequent iterations of this phase, the main focus will be on determining whether previously identified needs have changed. This detailed understanding of user needs is the critical part of this sub-process.
