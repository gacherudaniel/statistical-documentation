This sub-process checks whether current sources of data could meet user requirements and the conditions under which they would be available including any restrictions on their use. An assessment of possible alternatives including research into potential administrative or other non-statistical sources of data, to: 

i.Determine whether they would be suitable for use for statistical purposes;  
ii.Assess the division of responsibilities between data providers and the statistical organisation;
iii.Check necessary ICT resources as well as any formal agreements with data providers for accessing and sharing the data.

After existing sources have been assessed, a strategy for filling any remaining gaps in the data requirement is prepared. This may include identifying possible partnerships with data holders. This sub-process also includes a more general assessment of the legal framework in which data would be collected and used and may therefore identify proposals for changes to existing legislation or the introduction of a new legal framework
