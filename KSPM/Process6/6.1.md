# 6.1 Prepare draft outputs

This sub-process is where the data from sub-processes 5.7 (Calculate aggregates) and 5.8 (Finalise data files) are transformed into statistical outputs such as indexes, seasonally adjusted statistics, e.g. trend, cycle, seasonal and irregular components, accessibility measures, etc., as well as the recording of quality characteristics such as coefficients of variation. The preparation of maps, GIS outputs and geo-statistical services can be included to maximise the value and capacity to analyse the statistical information.
