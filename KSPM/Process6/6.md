# Analyse

88.In this phase, statistical outputs are produced and examined in detail. It includes preparing 
statistical content (including commentary, technical notes, etc.), and ensuring outputs are **fit for purpose** before dissemination to users. Data analysis will involve the inspection, cleaning, transforming, and modelling of the data to make it useful information. This phase also includes the sub-processes and activities that enable statistical analysts to understand the data and the statistics produced. The outputs of this phase could also be used as input to other sub-processes (e.g., analysis of new sources as input to the **Design** phase). For statistical outputs produced regularly, this phase occurs in every iteration. 

The **"Analyse"** phase and sub-processes are generic for all statistical outputs, regardless of how the data were sourced.
89. The "Analyse" phase is broken down into five sub-processes, which are generally sequential, from left to right, but can also occur in parallel, and can be iterative.

- [6.1 Prepare draft outputs](6.1.md)
- [6.2 Validate outputs](6.2.md)
- [6.3 Interpret and explain outputs](6.3.md)
- [6.4 Apply disclosure control](6.4.md)
- [6.5 Finalise outputs](6.5.md)
