# Apply disclosure control

This sub-process ensures that the data (and metadata) to be disseminated do not breach the appropriate rules on confidentiality according to either organisation policies and rules, or to the process-specific methodology created in sub-process 2.5 (Design processing and analysis). This may include checks for primary and secondary disclosure, as well as the application of data suppression or perturbation techniques and output checking. The degree and method of statistical disclosure control may vary for different types of outputs. For example, the approach used for microdata sets for research purposes will be different to that for published tables, finalised outputs of geospatial statistics or visualisations on maps.
