- Determining the level of release, and applying caveats;
- Collating supporting information, including interpretation, commentary, technical notes, briefings, measures of uncertainty and any other necessary metadata;
- Producing the supporting internal documents;
- Conducting pre-release discussions with appropriate internal subject matter experts;
- Translating the statistical outputs in countries with multilingual dissemination;
- Approving the statistical content for release.
