# Interpret and explain outputs

This sub-process is where the in-depth understanding of the outputs is gained by statisticians. They use that understanding to interpret and explain the statistics by assessing how well the statistics reflect their initial expectations, viewing the statistics from all perspectives using different tools and media, and carrying out in-depth statistical analyses such as time-series analysis, consistency and comparability analysis, revision analysis (analysis of the differences between preliminary and revised estimates), analysis of asymmetries (discrepancies in mirror statistics), etc.
