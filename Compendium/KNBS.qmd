# Domain 1 - Demographic and social statistics

## 101 Population 

Population refers to the totality of all units of interest in a study or investigation at a given time in a given area.

**101.1 Abortion\
**  Abortion is defined, with reference to the woman, as any interruption of pregnancy before 28 weeks of gestation with a dead foetus. There are two major categories of abortion: spontaneous and induced. Induced abortions are those initiated by deliberate action undertaken with the intention of terminating pregnancy; all other abortions are considered spontaneous.

**101.2 Adoption\
** Adoption is the legal and voluntary taking and treating of the child of other parents as one's own in so far as provided by the laws of the country. By means of a judicial process, whether related or not to the adopter, the adopted child acquires the rights and status of a legitimate child.

**101.3 Age dependency ratio\
** Agedependency ratios give the number of economically inactive people in relation to each economically active person. Classifications of economically active and inactive are usually made on the basis of age, with everyone aged less than 15 and everyone aged 65 and over considered economically inactive. The overall dependency ratio can be broken down into constituent parts, giving the child dependency ratio (number of children in relation to each economically active person) and the old-age dependency ratio (number of people aged 65 and over in relation to each economically active person).

**101.4 Age misreporting\
** This is the misreporting/mistating of a person's age by giving a value which is less or more than actual, either intentionally or unintentionally.

**101.5 Age ratio\
** It is the proportion of population in a given age group to its adjacent age groups, that is the successive and the preceding age groups.

**101.6 Age\
** Age is the interval of time between the day, month and year of birth and the day, month and year of occurrence of the event expressed in the largest completed unit of solar time such as years for adults and children and months, weeks, days, hours or minutes of life, as appropriate, for infants under one year of age.

**101.7 Age-sex accuracy index\
** It is an index that combines both the sex ratio and the age ratio for both males and females to generate a joint score. The score is used to evaluate the quality of age and sex data in population censuses or surveys.

**101.8 Age-Specific Fertility Rate\
**  Refers to the annual number of births to women of a specified age or age group per 1,000 women in that age group.

**101.9 Annulment of a marriage\
** The invalidation or voiding of a marriage by a competent authority, according to the laws of each country, which confers on the parties the status of never having been married to each other.

b)     a periodic household sample survey conducted in the same geographical area.

**101.10 Base population\
** It is the starting or reference population on which population projections are based. In most cases the enumerated population is used as a base population.

**101.11 Birth (or parity) order\
** Birth (or parity) order refers to the numerical order of the live birth or foetal death, recorded in relation to all previous pregnancy outcomes of the mother, irrespective of whether the outcome is a live birth or foetal death or whether pregnancies were nuptial or extranuptial.

**101.12 Birth registration\
** Refers to the process of recording a child's birth. It is a permanent and official record of a child's existence and provides legal recognition of that child's identity. It establishes a legal record of where the child was born and who the child's parents are.

**101.13 Burial permit\
** A burial permit is an official statement authorising the removal of the dead body (corpse) to the cemetery.

**101.14 Child Headed Household\
** A household whose head and main decision maker or source of livelihood is below the age of 18 years.

**101.15 Children Ever Born (CEB)\
** Refers to the life-time fertility experience of women 12 years and above. It is the total number of children a woman has given birth to in her lifetime.

**101.16 Cohort\
** A cohort is a group of people who experienced the same demographic event during a particular period of time. This will most commonly refer to births during a set period of time, but may also refer to marriages, onset of puberty, migration, first birth etc.

**101.17 Completeness of registration of a vital event\
** This is the proportion of vital events that are registered. It is the number of registered vital events divided by an estimate of the actual number of vital events that occurred in the same population during a specific period of time.

**101.18 Content errors\
** These are errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.

**101.19 Coverage errors\
**  These are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.

**101.20 Crude divorce rate\
**  The crude divorce rate is the number of divorces occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.

**101.21 Crude marriage rate\
**  The crude marriage rate is the number of marriages occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.

**101.22 Current Fertility\
**  Refers to births that occurred to a woman in the 12 months before the census or survey date.

**101.23 Date of birth\
**  The date of birth is the hour (minute), day, month and year of birth established in order that exact age may be determined in completed years, months, days, hours (minutes) of life as required.

**101.24 De facto population\
**  De facto population consists of all persons who are physically present in the country or area of enumeration at the population and housing census enumeration reference date, whether or not they are usual residents.

**101.25 De jure population\
** De jure population consists of all usual residents, whether or not they are present at the time of the population and housing census enumeration.

**101.26 Death\
** Death is the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after the occurrence of live birth, i.e., the postnatal cessation of vital functions without capability of resuscitation. This definition excludes foetal deaths.

**101.27 Defacto female headed household\
**  Is the household where the husband is not present and the wife becomes the main decision maker in his absence during a survey or census data collection exercise.

**101.28 Defacto Population Census\
**  The collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all people who will have spent a specified night in the reference area. A de facto census involves counting people who spent a specified night in a household or an institution.

**101.29 Dejure female headed household\
** Is the household where the main decision maker is a female who has never been married or is divorced or is legally separated or widowed during a data collection exercise.

**101.30 Dejure Population Census\
** The collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all the people who normally reside in the country. It will exclude visitors from other countries and include residents who will be outside the country at the time of enumeration. At household or institution level the dejure census includes only the usual members. The problem with the dejure census is to define the "usual member" of a household or an institution.

**101.31 Delayed Registration of a vital event\
**  The registration of a vital event after the prescribed period denoted in existing laws, rules, or regulations (including any grace period, if one is specified). A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the preschgfdribed time period but within a specified grace period. In Kenya, the grace period is from the third to sixth month following the event.

**101.32 Demographic transition\
**  The demographic transition is the process by which populations move from high mortality and fertility rates to low mortality and fertility rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This is typically demonstrated through a demographic transition model. As fertility decline often lags behind mortality decline, there is an intermediate phase in the middle of the transition characterised by high growth rates.

**101.33 Divorce\
** Divorce is the final legal dissolution of a marriage; a separation of husband and wife that confers on the parties the right to remarriage under civil, religious and/or other provisions in accordance with the laws of the country.

**101.34 Dual events\
** Are those occurring simultaneously in the lives of two individuals, which cannot occur again in the life of either individual without a previous change to his or her status. Those events include marriage, registered partnership, separation, divorce, legal dissolution of registered partnerships and annulment of marriage.

**101.35 Dual records system\
** A dual records system is the simultaneous collection of vital events, mainly births and deaths and the appropriate exposed-to-the-risk population, by two collecting methods which, ideally, are independent of each other:

a)      a continuous vital event recording procedure which may be other than the civil registration system; and

b)     a periodic household sample survey conducted in the same geographical area.

Matching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.

**  Foetal Death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the period of gestation. Death is indicated by the fact that after such separation, the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.

**101.43 Habitable Rooms\
** Habitable rooms are defined as places/spaces in the dwelling unit that are used mainly for living and exclude stores, granaries, offices, toilets and garages.

**101.44 Head of Household\
** Is the most responsible member of a household who makes key decisions of the household on a day-to-day basis and whose authority is recognized by all members of the household. It could be the father, mother or a child, or any other responsible member within the household.

**101.45 Homestead\
**  It is an isolated compound with one or more structures, and may be inhabited by one or more households. In most cases, fences, hedges, walls, etc. surround homesteads. A homestead may contain, for example, a hut or a group of huts. A manyatta, thus is considered as a homestead. However, a wall/fence or hedge need not necessarily surround a homestead. For instance, boys' quarters, garage, kitchen, etc. may be part of a homestead whether or not they are surrounded by a fence/wall, etc.

**101.46 Household Member\

**101.52 Legitimation\
**  The formal investing of a person with the status and rights of a person born in wedlock, according to the laws of each country.

**101.53 Lifetime Fertility\
**  Refers to the total number of children ever born alive during the entire reproductive period of the woman.

**101.54 Live Birth\

**101.55 Male Headed Household\
** A household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a man.

**101.56 Marriage\
**  An act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of spouses is constituted. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognized by the laws of each country. Countries may wish to expand the definition to cover civil unions if they are registered. In that case, registered partnership usually refers to a legal construct, entailing registration with the public authorities according to the laws of each country, that becomes the basis for legal conjugal obligations between two persons.

Matching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.

**101.62 Population Density\
** Population density is calculated as the total population divided by the total area which that population resides in. It provides a simple measure of the pressure of population on space and resources.

**103.18103.118 Labour Underutilization**

Thisrefers to mismatches between labour supply and demand, which translate into an unmet need for employment among the population. There are several measures of labour underutilization including unemployment, time-related underemployment, the potential labour force, and the LU1-LU4 rates.

**103.19 Time-related Underemployment**

This is defined as all persons in employment who wanted to work additional hours, whose working time in all jobs was less than a specified hours threshold, and who were available to work additional hours given an opportunity for more work.

**103.20 Potential Labour Force**

This is a subset of persons outside the labour force, which aims to measure the potential supply of labour, or in other words, it quantifies all persons with an unmet need for income-generating work and provides a measure of their degree of labour market integration.

**103.30 Informal Sector Enterprises**

Informal sector enterprises are **unincorporated household enterprises** that are **not formally constituted, recognized, or regulated by government authorities**, or are not sufficiently covered by formal arrangements in law or in practice.

## 106 Income and consumption

Households have personal needs and wants that are directly satisfied through consumption of goods and services resulting from activities that are productive in an economic sense. These goods and services are referred to as consumer goods and services and their individual value is defined as the consumption expenditure on these goods or services. 

**106.1 Household income**

Household income is the sum of money income and income in kind and consists of receipts which, as a rule, are of a recurring nature and accrue to the household or to individual members of the household regularly at annual or at more frequent intervals (ILO,2000). Household income consists of receipts in cash, in kind or in services, that are usually recurrent and regular and are received by the household or by individual members of the household at annual or at more frequent intervals. During the reference period when they are received, such receipts are potentially available for current consumption and, as a rule, do not reduce the net worth of the household (ILO,2001). Income is thus defined in terms of a broad grouping of sources of income as follows:

**106.2 Income from employment**

Income from employment comprises receipts from involvement in economic activities, strictly in an employment-related capacity. It consists of employee income (e.g. wages) and self-employment income (return to labour), (ILO, 2000).

**106.3 Employee income**

Employee income consists of direct wages and salaries, cash bonuses and gratuities, commissions, directors’ fees, profit-sharing bonuses and other forms of profit-related pay, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. as sick leave or annual leave), free or subsidized goods and services from an employer as well as severance and termination pay. Employee income can be in cash (in the sense of monetary), in kind as goods or services.

**106.4 Income from self employment**

Income from self-employment is defined as the income which is received, over a given reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of their current or former involvement in self-employment jobs” (ILO 2000). Income from self employment is taken as income received as a result of involvement in a self-employment job. It should be noted that this component is restricted to owners of unincorporated enterprises who work in such enterprises.

**106.5 Property Income**

Property incomeis income received from ownership of financial and other assets, e.g. interest payments. Property income consists of receipts received as a result of ownership of financial and non-financial assets that are provided to others for their use. These are usually in the form of interest receipts, dividends, rents received for the use of unproduced assets (natural resources), royalties for use of intellectual property and rents received for produced assets.

**106.6 Income from household production of services for own consumption**

This is income from household production of services for own consumption, e.g. services of owner-occupied housing, household production of domestic services for own consumption. These are services produced within the household for the household’s own consumption and not for the market. They include services from owner-occupied dwellings and from consumer durable goods owned as well as own-produced domestic services. They are valued net of expenses that go into their production

**106.7 Transfers**

Transfers are receipts for which there is no “quid pro quo”, i.e. nothing tangible is given by the recipient to the donor in return for the receipts. Transfers may be made between households, between households and government or between households and charities. Transfers are mainly  motivated by the intention to redistribute income. Transfers can consist of cash (monetary) or goods or of services and can cross national boundaries. Capital transfers are one-off or irregular and are usually large, lump-sum receipts. In contrast, current transfers usually recur regularly and tend to be small. Current transfers are also mostly available for use in consumption expenditure during the reference period while recipients of capital transfers do not usually regard them as income and do not use them wholly for consumption expenditure during the reference period.

**106.8 Current Transfers (in cash and goods)**

Current transfers whether in cash or goods consist of social security pensions/schemes; pensions and other insurance benefits; current transfers from non-profit institutions and current transfers from other households.

**106.9 Current Transfers (Services)**

These aresocial transfers in kind from government-provided services to individual households such as education, health, social welfare, transport and cultural services.

**106.10 Holding gains**

Holding gains are changes in the value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities over a reference period which occur without any direct action of the owner, for example, changes in the value of stocks and shares. A holding gain, the result of an increase in assets or a reduction in liability, increases the net worth of the owner’s assets while a loss has the opposite effect.

**106.11 Household Consumption Expenditure**

This is the value of consumer goods and services that were acquired (used or paid for) by a household for the direct satisfaction of the needs and wants of its members through direct monetary purchases in the market; through the market-place but without using any money as means of payment (barter, income in kind); or from production within the household (own-account production).

**106.12 Consumption expenditure on non-durable goods and services**

This is expenditure incurred on goods including food items, personal care items, fuel, educational and entertainment items,  household items such as cleaning products and so on.

**106.13CConsumption expenditure on durable goods**

This is expenditure on household kitchen appliances, household information and entertainment appliances, other household appliances, household transportation equipment, other household items, clothing items, utensils, and so on. Consumer goods that are used many times over a long period of time without reducing their capacity to satisfy needs and wants are referred to as durable goods.

## 107 Social Protection

**Social Protection\
** Social protection is the systematic intervention intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of social risks. Social protection can be organized as social assistance or social insurance schemes, with the latter organized as social security schemes or employment-related social insurance schemes.” Kenya’s social protection sector is structured into three pillars: social assistance, social security and social health insurance.

**107.1 Cash transfers**

These are direct, regular and predictable transfers that raise and smooth incomes to reduce poverty and vulnerability. Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) are for the beneficiary to decide how to spend. Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are given with the requirement that the beneficiary meets certain conditions – often related to human capital development, such as visiting a health clinic or ensuring children go to school.

**107.2 Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund**

This Fund was established under Section 28 of the SHIA (2023), and it covers costs related to managing chronic illnesses after the depletion of social health insurance cover and funds emergency treatment.

The Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund has diverse funding sources, including appropriations by the National Assembly, gifts, grants, donations, endowments, or funds from any other lawful source.

**107.3 Inua Jamii 70 years and above cash transfer programme (IJ70+)**

The objective of the program is to uplift the lives of poor and vulnerable Kenyans through regular and reliable cash transfers. It represents the first building block towards a universal social protection system in Kenya. The programme is completely funded by the Government and aims to reach all people aged 70 or older who are not already in receipt of a civil service pension, providing them with a monthly cash transfer disbursed every two months.

**107.4 National Safety Net Programme (NSNP)**

This is a programme that provides a common operating framework to harmonise the delivery of Kenya’s tax-financed social protection schemes.

**107.5 National Social Security Fund**

**107.6 Primary Healthcare Fund**

This is a fund that focuses on procuring primary healthcare services from health facilities. It is funded through various sources, including appropriations by the National Assembly, grants, gifts, donations, bequests, fees, levies, and funds from other relevant sources. SHI aims to remove limitations on specific medical expenses, such as pre-treatment blood works and certain CT scans, and includes coverage for congenital conditions and preventive measures not previously covered.

**107.7 Public works programmes (PWPs)**

These are programmes that provide jobs on infrastructure projects for cash or food. They are sometimes classified as labour market interventions depending on whether their function is primarily poverty alleviation, job creation, or social protection. In Kenya, such programmes include ‘Kazi Kwa Vijana’.

**107.8 Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA)**

This is a regulatory body established by the Government of Kenya to supervise the establishment and management of retirement benefits schemes in the Republic of Kenya.

**107.11 Social Health Authority (SHA)**

This is a State corporation under the Government of Kenya responsible for the provision and management of public health insurance within the Republic of Kenya. The core mandate of the SHA is to provide accessible, affordable, sustainable, and quality health insurance for all Kenyan citizens and, where applicable, foreign residents.

**107.12 Social Health Insurance (SHI)**

This is a social health insurance system in Kenya that is operated through individuals contributing funds to a common pool through regular premiums, deducted from salaries or paid directly, to finance care services for themselves and their dependents. The Social Health Insurance Fund is governed by the Social Health Insurance Act (SHIA) of 2023 and it introduces three funds: Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), Primary Healthcare Fund and Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund.

**107.13 Social Health Insurance Fund**

This is a fund aimed at promoting the implementation of universal health coverage by ensuring all individuals and communities receive the health services they need, including the full spectrum of essential, quality health services from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care without suffering financial hardship. The fund has been established by the government to improve the quality of life for all citizens by providing equitable, accessible, affordable, and high-standard healthcare.

**107.14 Social Insurance**

These are contributory programmes where participants make regular payments to a scheme that will cover costs related to life-course events, for example, maternity, unemployment or illness. Social insurance includes contributory pensions; health, unemployment, or disaster insurance; and funeral assistance. Social insurance is strongly linked to the formal labour market, meaning coverage is often limited to formal workers.

**107.15 Social pensions**

These are state pensions, a form of cash transfer targeted by age. Pensions are the most common social protection tool, with the widest global coverage and often highest national spend. The current pensions schemes in Kenya comprise the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) which is a state contributory scheme mandatory for all employers and employees in the formal sector and informal sector workers who can contribute on voluntary basis, Civil Servants Pension Scheme which is non-contributory and administered by The National Treasury for the government for retired civil servants and (iii) private pension schemes.

**107.16 Social risks**

Defined as events or circumstances that may adversely affect the welfare of households either by imposing additional demands on their resources or by reducing their income. Needs may occur due to sickness, unemployment, retirement, housing, education, or family circumstances.

**107.17 Social Security**

Social security is defined as the security that the society furnishes through appropriate organizations against certain risks to which its members are exposed. The concept of social security is based on ideas of human dignity and social justice. The underlying idea behind social security measures is that a citizen who has contributed or is likely to con­tribute to his/her country’s welfare should be given protection against certain hazards. The concept of social security, thus, is based on the ideals of human dignity and socio-economic justice. Underlying the concept is also the desire to give protection to its citizens to contribute to a coun­try’s total welfare against certain hazards of life to which they are exposed either in the working life or as a consequence of it.

**107.18107.18 The Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC)**

**107.19 The Cash Transfer Persons with Severe Disabilities (CT-PwSD)**

This is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme that seeks to enhance the capacities of care givers through cash transfers and as such, improve the livelihoods of persons with severe disabilities as well as reduce negative impact of disability on households. It targets adults and children with severe disabilities, who require full time support of a caregiver. The objectives of the programme are to: to strengthen the capacities of parents and children with disabilities; improve the livelihoods of parents and children with disabilities and to alleviate integrated poverty among parents and children with disabilities.

## 110 Time-Use

#### 110.1 Average time spent

The average time spent in an activity can be computed either with reference to the whole population of the category or specifically to those who participated in the activity. Therefore, the participation rate for the activity is required, and two series of tables are presented:

1.        Average time spent per day by the population and

2.        Average time spent per day by persons who engaged in the activity.

Basic time use statistics typically provide estimates of the average time spent per day on various types of activities by individuals within specific demographic groups. These categories may include men, women, boys, and girls within certain age groups, as well as distinctions such as rural or urban residence, employment status, and more. To ensure accurate averages, time use data should encompass both weekdays and weekends, and account for seasonal variations throughout the year.

#### 110.2 Participation rate

The participation rate refers to the proportion of individuals in the survey population who took part in a specific activity during the reference period, such as in  the last 24 hours.

An activity is considered non-productive if it cannot be delegated to someone else, according to the "third-person rule." These include personal maintenance activities such as eating, sleeping, exercising and leisure or recreational activities such as watching TV, playing games and hobbies.

#### 110.8 Productive work

Productive work refers to activities that can be delegated to another person and still produce the same result. All such activities fall within the general production boundary.

#### 110.9 Reproductive work

Reproductive work includes activities such as rearing and caring for children; caring for the elderly, ill, disabled and other household members; caring unpaid for non-family members; and cooking, cleaning and fetching water and fuel. Though these activities are productive, they are not included in GDP calculations.

**110.10 Care of children and adults**

This refers to time spent caring for or helping any child (under 18) or adult in the household, regardless of their health status. Care is categorized into:

**11010.01 Primary childcare**

Time spent directly and exclusively on a child while not engaged in any other activity, such as feeding, bathing, playing, or helping with homework.

**11010.02  Primary adult care**

Time spent directly helping or caring for an adult, such as bathing, grooming, or assisting with household tasks like cleaning or cooking.

**11010.03 Secondary care of children and adults**

Care provided while engaged in another primary activity. For example, watching over a child doing homework while cooking dinner or watching over a sick parent while doing house chores

**110.11 Time-use surveys**

Statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary informationfor estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.

**110.12 Passive Care**

Monitoring or supervising another person without direct interaction. For example, watching children get dressed or supervising a family member taking medication. This may occur while performing other tasks or as a primary activity.

**110.13 Active Care**

Active care involves direct interaction with the person being cared for. Examples include helping someone dress or administering medication.

**110.14 Household Production Satellite Account**

A statistical framework that estimates the value of unpaid work in the household, such as childcare, adult care, housework, and volunteering. Specifically, the household production satellite accounts show the relation between the monetary value of unpaid work to the total GDP providing relevant information that complements the GDP.

**110.15 Simultaneous or parallel activities**

These involve performing two or more activities during the same time interval. The primary activity is the one whose value added exceeds that of other activities and it's deemed most important or requiring the most concentration. The secondary activity is carried out at the same time as the primary activity but considered of lesser importance

**110.16 Time-use diaries**

Diaries that capture all activities undertaken by a respondent over a defined reference period (e.g. a full 24-hour period, a weekday and a weekend day, a full week, etc.). They capture start and end times, activity duration, sequence, and frequency.

**110.17 Activity classification system**

A structured system that categorizes activities into groups to analyze how people spend their time. It supports policymaking and statistical reporting through a hierarchical structure that assigns numeric codes to each activity.

**110.18 International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics (ICATUS):**

A standard classification of all activities that the general population may engage in over a 24 hours period. The classification provides categories for compiling internationally comparable time-use statistic

Paid work

Unpaid work

**102.19  Productive activity**

an activity is considered productive if it can be delegated to someone else or if it yields an output that is capable of being exchanged.

**102.20 Unproductive activity/Personal care activit**y

Activities performed for personal maintenance and care such as eating, drinking, sleeping, exercising etc. are non-productive or personal activities: these cannot be delegated to a person other than the one benefiting from them. Similarly, activities associated with socializing, entertainment, participation in sports, hobbies and games, and use of mass media are considered non-productive activities.

# Domain 2 - Economic Statistics 

## 201 Macroeconomic accounts and statistics

**20101 System of National Accounts**

**20101.1 System of National Accounts (SNA)**

The internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity. It is a comprehensive, consistent and flexible set of macroeconomic accounts to meet the needs of government and private-sector analysts, policymakers, and decision-takers.

**20101.2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**

The total value of goods and services produced by resident producer units of a country for a specified period of time, usually one year. It is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units (institutional sectors or industries).

**20101.3 GDP at Market Prices**

The sum total of the gross values added of all resident producers at producers’ prices, less subsidies on imports, plus all non-deductible Value Added Taxes (VAT) (or similar taxes).

**20101.4 GDP at current Prices**

The total value of goods and services valued at prices of the particular year of reporting. This is also referred to as nominal GDP.

**20101.5 Base Year**

The year used as the base period for compilation of constant price estimates. The base year is reflected to be normal i.e. a year without major  shocks or structural changes. The base year of the national accounts is chosen to allow for year-to-year comparisons.

**20101.6 GDP at Constant Prices**

The total value of goods and services for a particular period based on prices of a pre-determined base year.

**20101.7 GDP per Capita**

The average production per person of goods and services for a specified period e.g. one year. It is used to compare the relative welfare or standard of living in different countries in a particular period.

**20101.8 Gross Output**

Output that consists of goods or services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use.

**20101.9 Intermediate Consumption**

Consists of the value of the goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital; the goods or services may be either transformed or used up by the production process.

**20101.10 Gross** **Value Added (GVA)**

GVA is derived as the gross output less the intermediate consumption.

**20101.11Compensation of Employees**

This is the total remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees and comprises wages and salaries and the value of social contributions paid by employers.

**20101.12 Operating Surplus**

The operating surplus measures the surplus or deficit accruing from production before taking account of any interest, rent or similar charges payable on financial or tangible non-produced assets borrowed or rented by the enterprise, or any interest, rent or similar receipts receivable on financial or tangible non-produced assets owned by the enterprise; (note: for unincorporated enterprises owned by households, this component is called "mixed income").

**20101.13 Mixed Income**

The surplus or deficit accruing from production by unincorporated enterprises owned by households; it implicitly contains an element of remuneration for work done by the owner, or other members of the household, that cannot be separately identified from the return to the owner as entrepreneur, but it excludes the operating surplus coming from owner-occupied dwellings.

**20101.14 Other Taxes on Production**

Taxes other than those incurred directly as a result of engaging in production; they mainly consist of current taxes on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings.

**20101.15 Basic Prices**

The amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.

**20101.16 Purchasers’ Prices**

The amount paid by the purchaser, excluding any deductible VAT or similar deductible tax, in order to take delivery of a unit of a good or service at the time and place required by the purchaser; the purchaser's price of a good includes any transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place.

**20101.17 Government Final Consumption Expenditure**

Expenditure, including imputed expenditure, incurred by the general government on both individual consumption goods and services and collective consumption services.

**20101.18 General Government**

The sector consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.

**20101.19 Household/Private Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE)**

Expenditure incurred by the resident households on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.

**20101.20 Final consumption expenditure by NPISH**

The Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is defined as the expenditure incurred by the resident non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.

**20101.21 Gross Fixed Capital Formation**

This is measured as the total value of a producer's acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of institutional units. Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.

**20101.22** **Fixed Assets**

Tangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.

**20101.23** **Consumption of Fixed Capital**

Constitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage. In other words it is the wear and tear of an asset during the accounting period.

**20101.24 Changes in Inventories**

Changes in inventories (including work-in-progress) consist of changes in :(a) stocks of outputs that are still held by the units that produced them prior to their being further processed, sold, delivered to other units or used in other ways; and(b) stocks of products acquired from other units that are intended to be used for intermediate consumption or for resale without further processing; they are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories.

**20101.25 GDP by Production Approach**

The production approach, which is also called the output approach, measures GDP as the difference between value of output less the value of goods and services used in producing these outputs during an accounting period

**20101.26 GDP by Expenditure Approach**

GDP by expenditure approach also known as the aggregate demand is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.

**20101.27 GDP by Income approach**

The income approach estimates GDP as the sum of the incomes receivable by each institutional sector from the domestic production of goods and services.

**20101.28 Gross National Income (GNI)**

The aggregate value of the gross balances of primary incomes for all sectors. GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.

**20101.29 Gross National Disposable Income**

Gross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.

**20101.30 Saving**

Net saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.

**20101.31 Net Lending/Borrowing**

Net amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as "net borrowing".

**20101.32 GDP Statistical Discrepancy**

This is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.

**20101.33 Supply and use Tables**

The Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported.  The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.

**20101.34 Input-Output Tables**

An input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.

**20101.35 Social Accounting Matrices (SAM)**

A means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).

**20101.36 Satellite Accounts**

Satellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.

**20102 Balance of payments and international investment position**

**20102.1 Balance of Payments**

A systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.

**20102.2 Current Account**

The current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.

**20102.3 Goods Account**

Includes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.

**20102.4 Services Account**

It covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of  intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government  goods and services n.i.e

**20102.5 Primary Income Account**

Primary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.

**20102.6 Secondary Income Account**

This account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:

●           Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.

●           Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.

**20102.7 Current Account Balance**

The current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:

Current Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account

**20102.8 Current Account Surplus/Deficit**

A current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.

**20102.9 Capital Account**

This account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.

Capital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit  institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt

Non-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).

**20102.10 Financial Account**

This account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives  and Reserve Assets.

**20102.11 Direct Investment**

This arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.

Enterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.

**20102.12 Portfolio Investment**

This is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.

Portfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.

**20102.13 Other Investment**

This captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment ,Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.

Other investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.

**20102.14 Reserve Assets**

Reserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .

**20102.15 International Investment Position**

International Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.

The difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.

**20102.16 Financial Assets**

These are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.

**20102.17 Financial Liabilities**

Financial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.

**20102.18 Rest of the world**

Consists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.

**20102.19 Residency**

A resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.

A legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.

A Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.

An exception to this rule includes the following:

1.          Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.

2.          International/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.

**20102.20 Transactions**

A transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.

**20102.21 Positions**

Stock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.

**20102.22 Financial Instruments**

These are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:

•            Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.

•            Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.

**20102.23 Reinvested Earnings**

Income on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).

**20102.24 Revaluations**

Changes in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.

**20102.25 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)**

SDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries' official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.

**20102.26 Valuation Principles**

Valuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.

**20102.27 Accrual Accounting**

Accrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.

**20102.28 Market Value**

Market prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.

**20102.29 Book Value**

The value recorded in the enterprises records.

**20102.30 Nominal Value**

The outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.

**20102.31 Amortized value**

The amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.

**20102.32 Face value**

The undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).

**20102.33 Net Errors and Omissions**

In practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.

**20102.34 Institutional Sectors**

BPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:

●      Central Bank

○        Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank

○        General government

●      Other Sectors

■      Other financial corporations

●      Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)

●      Non-MMF Investment funds

●      Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)

●       Financial auxiliaries

●      Captive financial institutions and money lenders

●       Insurance corporations

●      Pension funds

■      Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs

●      Nonfinancial corporations

●       Households

●      NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)

The full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.

**20102.35 Exceptional Financing**

Brings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.

**20102.36 The International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)**

This is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.

Statistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.

However, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.

**20102.37 Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition**

The Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It provides standards for compiling and presenting Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Positions (IIP).

**20103 Government Finance Statistics**

Covers statistical activities on the general government sector and the broader public sector. It covers the compilation of data on revenues, expenditures, transactions in financial assets and liabilities, and balance sheet data.

**20103.1 Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG)**

Classification of the government outlays by functions, or socio-economic objectives, that general government units aim to achieve through the outlays.

**20103.2 Economic classification**

Classification of government outlays used to identify the types of expense incurred when a government supplies goods and services to the community or redistributes income and wealth.

**20103.3 Expense**

A transaction involving exchange and transfer that reduces the net worth of the government.

**20103.4 Revenue**

A set of exchange and transfer transactions that increase the net worth of the government.

**20103.5 Compensation of employees**

The expense involving total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable to a government employee in return for work done during the accounting period, except for work connected to own-account capital formation

**20103.6 Use of Goods and Service**

An expense that involves purchase of goods and services for production of market and nonmarket goods and services Plus goods purchased for resale Minus the change in inventories of materials, work-in- progress, finished goods, and goods held for resale.

**20103.185 Raceways**

Channels or open water courses used in commercial aquaculture to raise fish in a high-density, intensive system. These are fixed structures that are used for raising aquatic organisms or plants. These structures are elongated, narrow channels, unlike tanks. Raceways are constructed above the ground and designed to allow water to flow continuously through them. This flow of water enables efficient feeding and waste removal.

**20103.186 Dams**

Stagnant waters created as a result of barriers erected to stop or restrict the flow of water or underground streams, sometimes used for integrated aquaculture and energy production. In terms of size, dams are generally larger than 1.0 ha but smaller than 100 ha.

**20103.189  Fertilization**

Process of adding nutrients to a pond to increase the number of phytoplankton and other aquatic life, which in turn provides more food for fish.

**20103.190  Aquaponics**

The combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. In aquaponics, the nutrient-rich water that results from raising fish provides a source of natural fertilizer for the growing plants. As the plants consume the nutrients, they help to purify the water that the fish live in. A natural microbial process keeps both the fish and plants healthy. Aquaponics therefore produces both fish and organic or chemical free fruits and vegetables, in a dynamic, pond- type ecosystem.

###### 20303.37 Other energy producers

**E**conomic units (including households) that choose, or are forced by circumstance, to produce energy for their own consumption and/or to supply energy to other units, but for which energy production is not their principal activity. These units are engaged in the production, transformation and transmission/distribution of energy as a secondary and/or ancillary activity. This means that the “energy” output generated by these activities and measured in terms of value added does not exceed that of the principal activity of the unit. In the case of ancillary activities, the activities are carried out to support the principal and secondary activity of the unit.

###### 20303.38 Production 

The capture, extraction or manufacture of fuels or energy in forms that are ready for general use. In energy statistics, two types of production are distinguished, primary and secondary.

●             Primary production is the capture or extraction of fuels or energy from natural energy flows, the biosphere and natural reserves of fossil fuels within the national territory in a form suitable for use. Inert matter removed from the extracted fuels and quantities reinjected, flared or vented are **not** included. The resulting products are referred to as “primary” products.

●             Secondary production is the manufacture of energy products through the process of transformation of other fuels or energy, whether primary or secondary. The quantities of secondary fuels reported as production include quantities lost through venting and flaring during and after production.

###### 20303.39 Imports of energy products

All fuel and other energy products entering the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily admitted are excluded, while re-imports (i.e. domestic goods exported but subsequently readmitted) are included. The bunkering of fuel outside the reference territory by national merchant ships and civil aircraft engaged in international travel is also excluded from imports. Note that the country of origin of energy products should be recorded, where possible, as the country from which goods were imported, but not a transit country.

###### 20303.40 Exports of energy products

All fuel and other energy products leaving the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily withdrawn are excluded, while re-exports (i.e. foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported) are included. Also excluded are quantities of fuels delivered for use by merchant ships (including passenger ships) and civil aircraft of all nationalities during international transport of goods and passengers. Note that the country of destination of energy products (i.e. the country of the last known destination as it is known at the time of exportation) should be recorded as a country to which these products are exported to, but not a transit country.

It should be noted that the definitions of imports and exports used in energy statistics are those adopted by international merchandise trade statistics for a system of recording known as the general trade system, that is, all energy products entering and leaving the national territory of a country and which add to or are subtracted from the stock of material resources of a country are recorded as energy imports and exports, except for the bunkering of international fleet, which is excluded from trade figures. It should also be noted that, in energy balances, imports and exports exclude nuclear fuels as these are not within the scope of energy balances.

###### 20303.41 International marine bunkers

Quantities of fuels delivered to merchant ships (including passenger ships) of any nationality for consumption during international voyages transporting goods or passengers. International voyages take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by ships during domestic transportation, fishing or military uses are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy (see para. 5.94 for domestic navigation). For the purposes of energy statistics, international marine bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.

###### 20303.42 International aviation bunkers 

Quantities of fuels delivered to civil aircraft of any nationality for consumption during international flights transporting goods or passengers. International flights take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by aircraft undertaking domestic or military flights are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy. For the purposes of energy statistics, international aviation bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.

###### 20303.43 Stock changes

For the purposes of energy statistics, stocks are quantities of energy products that are held on the national territory and can be used to: (a) maintain service under conditions where supply and demand are variable in their timing or amount due to normal market fluctuations, or (b) supplement supply in the case of a supply disruption.Stocks used to manage a supply disruption may be called ”strategic” or “emergency” stocks and are often held separately from stocks designed to meet normal market fluctuations, but both are considered here. Stock changes are defined as the increase (stock build) or decrease (stock draw) in the quantity of stocks over the reporting period and thus are calculated as a difference between the closing and opening stocks.

###### 20303.44 Transfers

Essentially statistical devices to overcome practical classification and presentation issues resulting from changes in use or identity of a product. Transfers comprise products transferred and interproduct transfers. Products transferred refers to the reclassification (renaming) of products, which, for example, is necessary when finished oil products are used as feedstock in refineries. Interproduct transfers refer to the movements of fuels between product categories because of reclassification of a product that no longer meets its original specification. For example, aviation turbine fuel that has deteriorated or has been spoiled may be reclassified as heating kerosene.

###### 20303.45 Transformation 

The process where part or all of the energy content of a product entering a process moves from this product to one or more different products leaving the process (e.g., from coking coal to coke, from crude oil to oil products, or from fuel oil to electricity) (see section D.2 for further discussion).

###### 20303.46 Losses 

Losses during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, heat and electricity. Losses also include venting and flaring of manufactured gases, losses of geothermal heat after production and pilferage of fuels or electricity. However, production of secondary gases includes quantities subsequently vented or flared. This ensures that a balance can be constructed between the use of the primary fuels from which the gases are derived and the production of the gases.

###### 20303.47 Energy industries own use 

The consumption of fuels and energy for the direct support of the production and preparation for use of fuels and energy, except heat not sold. As such, it covers not only own use by energy industries as defined in para. 5.23, but also by other energy producers. Quantities of fuels transformed into other fuels or energy are not included here, but within transformation; neither are quantities used within parts of the energy industry not directly involved in the activities listed in the definition.

These quantities are reported within final consumption.

###### 20303.48 Non-energy use 

The use of energy products as raw materials for the manufacture of products outside the scope of SIEC, as well as for direct uses that do not involve using the products as a source of energy, nor as a transformation input. Examples are lubrication, sealing, preservation, road surfacing and use as a solvent.

Final consumption refers to all fuel and energy delivered to users for both their energy and non-energy uses, and which do not involve a transformation process.

###### 20303.49 Installation

A weighted aggregative index showing the ratio of expenditures in the current period (p2q1, where p2 is the current period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to the expenditure in the base period (p1q1, where p1 is the base period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to purchase the identical market basket of items. A laspeyres price index is computed by taking the ratio of the total cost of purchasing a specified group of commodities at current prices to the cost of that same group at base-period prices and multiplying by 100.

**205.25 Modified Laspyres Index**

In recent years, there has been a further modification of the Laspeyres formula to suit item replacements in the index basket from time to time due to several reasons, including the smooth substitution of new items and frequent weight updates every month. The modification yields the so-called modified Laspeyres’ formula.

**205.26 Monthly Inflation Rate**

The monthly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant month compared to the index of the previous month. The monthly inflation rate reflects short-term changes in the average prices.

**205.27 Outlet**

This refers to a place where goods and services can be purchased and from where the purchasers’ or list prices of the products sold can be obtained. It may be a shop, a market stall, a catalogue, a website, etc. Also referred to as a “retail outlet”, although it can include wholesale outlets which also sell directly to the consumer.

**205.28 Output Producer Price Index**

Measure of the change in the prices of goods and services sold as output by domestic producers. Covers both output sold on the domestic market and output sold as exports. Valuation is at basic prices.

**205.29 Price Relative**

A price relative is the ratio of the price of a specific product in one period to the price of the same product in some other period.

**205.30 Producer Price Index (PPI)**

Measure changes in the prices of domestic produced goods and services. It is a measure of the change in the prices of goods and services either as they leave their place of production or as they enter the production process.

**205.31 Products (also referred to as “commodities)**

These are goods and services normally intended for sale on the market at a price that is designed to cover their cost of production.

**205.32 Quarterly Inflation Rate**

The quarterly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant quarter compared to the index of the previous quarter. The quarterly inflation rate reflects short -term changes in the average prices.

**205.33 Representative Product**

Product, or category of products, that accounts for a significant proportion of the total expenditures within an elementary aggregate, and/or for which the average price change is expected to be close to the average for all products within the aggregate, e.g. maize flour may have a larger share than millet flour.

**205.34**  **Weight**

It is the relative consumption or production share of an item or group of items to the total consumption of households or production. In a CPI context, weight is the total household consumption expenditure on a given elementary aggregate expressed as a share of total consumption expenditure of all elementary aggregates.

**205.35**  **Weight of a Product/Service in an Index Basket**

It is the proportion of total household expenditure on that product/service during the weight reference period. It depicts the relative importance of goods and services in a basket.

This category only includes the acquisition of capital goods for innovation that is not included in R&D activities.

**206.3  Acquisition of other external knowledge**

This innovation activity includes the acquisition of rights to use patents and non-patented inventions, licences, disclosures of knowhow, trademarks, designs and patterns from other enterprises and institutions such as universities and government research institutions, other than R&D. Acquisition of external knowledge may also include computer services and other scientific and technical services for product and process innovations activities.

**206.4 All manufacturing firms**

Total number of firms in the manufacturing industry.

**206.5 Applied research**

Original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.

**206.6 Basic research**

It is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.

**206.7 Business enterprise expenditure on R&D (BERD)**

Represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Business enterprise sector (see the definition of Business enterprise sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Business enterprise sector during a specific reference period.

**206.8 Business enterprise sector (for R&D data)**

In the context of R&D statistics, the business enterprise sector comprises:

a.    All resident corporations, including not only legally incorporated enterprises, regardless of the residence of their shareholders. This group includes all other types of quasi-corporations, i.e. units capable of generating a profit or other financial gain for their owners, recognised by law as separate legal entities from their owners, and set up for purposes of engaging in market production at prices that are economically significant.

b.    The unincorporated branches of non-resident enterprises are deemed to be resident because they are engaged in production on the economic territory on a long-term basis.

c.    All resident non-profit institutions (NPIs) that are market producers of goods or services or serve business.

d.    This sector comprises both private and public enterprises.

**206.9 Business population**

All firms in the business sector, which can be disaggregated by economic activity and size class.

Capital R&D expenditures are the annual gross amount paid for the acquisition of fixed assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the performance of R&D for more than one year. They should be reported in full for the period when they took place, whether acquired or developed in house, and should not be registered as an element of depreciation. The most relevant types of assets used for R&D for which capital R&D expenditures should be compiled are:

a.    Land and buildings

b.    Machinery and equipment

c.    Capitalised computer software

d.    Other intellectual property products.

**206.10 Capitalised computer software (in capital R&D expenditures)**

This includes the costs of computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for more than one year. It includes longterm licences or the acquisition of separately identifiable computer software, including programme descriptions and supporting materials for both systems and applications software. The production costs (e.g. labour and materials) of internally produced software should be reported. Software from external vendors may be obtained through the outright purchase of rights or licences to use. Software used or licensed for one year or less should be reported under current expenditures.

**206.11 Contracted-out (external) R&D**

Any creative work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations but performed by other firms (including other firms or subsidiaries within the group) or by public or private research organizations and purchased by the firm.

**206.12 Cooperation for innovation activities**

Active participation in joint innovation projects with other organizations. Pure contracting out of work, where there is no active collaboration, is not regarded as cooperation.

**206.13 Current R&D expenditures**

These are composed of labour costs and other current costs (including for external R&D personnel) used in R&D. Services and items (including equipment) used and consumed within one year are current expenditures. Annual fees or rents for the use of fixed assets should be included in current expenditures.

**206.14 Degree of novelty - new to the firm**

Implementation by a firm of a new or significantly improved good or service that was already available from its competitors in the market. A product, process, marketing method or organizational method may already have been implemented by other firms, but if it is new to the firm, then it is an innovation for that firm.

**206.15 Degree of novelty - new to the market**

Implementation of a new or significantly improved good or service by a firm on its market before its competitors. The geographical scope of new to the market is subject to the firm’s own view of its operating market and may include both domestic and international firms.

**206.16 Degree of novelty - new to the world**

Innovation is new to the world when the firm is the first to implement the innovation for all markets and industries, domestic and international. New to the world therefore implies a qualitatively greater degree of novelty than new to the market.

**206.17 Engineering and technology (for R&D data)**

Engineering and technology include: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies.

**206.18 Exchange funds for R&D**

Exchange funds for R&D are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit in return for the performance of R&D and the delivery of relevant R&D outcomes. The unit funding the work incurs a delivery risk associated with the uncertainty of the project. Examples of exchange funds activities include R&D purchases (sales from the perspective of the performer), R&D outsourcing and contributions in the context of collaborative R&D agreements.

**206.19 Experimental development**

Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.

**206.20 External R&D funds**

External R&D funds are the amount of money spent on R&D that originate outside the control of a reporting unit.

**206.21 External R&D personnel**

External R&D personnel (or contributors) are independent (self-employed) or dependent (employee) workers fully integrated into a statistical unit’s R&D projects without formally being persons employed by the same R&D performing statistical unit.

**206.22 Extramural R&D**

Any R&D performed outside of the statistical unit about which information is being reported; its “funds for extramural R&D” should include only internal funds (not from external sources) provided to an outside unit for R&D performance including both where there is an expected compensatory delivery of R&D (exchange or purchase) and where no compensatory delivery is expected (transfer or grant). It may also be noted that such funds for extramural R&D often will include payments for costs other than for R&D, such as cost elements covering depreciation costs, performer profit, delivery charges, etc.

Fields of research and development (FORD) The fields of research and development (FORD) classification is used to classify R&D units and resources by fields of enquiry, namely, broad knowledge domains based primarily on the content of the R&D subject matter. The main fields of R&D are:

a.       Natural sciences

b.      Engineering and technology

c.       Medical and health sciences

d.      Agricultural and veterinary sciences

e.       Social sciences

f.        Humanities and the arts.

**206.23 Firms with only abandoned or ongoing innovation activities**

Firms that did not implement innovations but had abandoned or ongoing innovation activities to develop them. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.

**206.24 Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel** 

This is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. In other words, one full-time equivalent may be thought of as one person-year. Therefore, it is measured by combining two variables: actual involvement in R&D activities and formal engagement on the basis of normative/statutory working hours. FTE is considered to be a true measure of the volume of R&D and also the main R&D personnel statistic for international comparisons.

**206.25 GERD as a percentage of GDP** 

Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP is the total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a percentage of GDP of the national territory.

**206.26 GERD by fields of research and development**

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the fields of research and development. The fields included are:

a.     Natural sciences

b.    Engineering and technology

c.     Medical and health sciences

d.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences

e.      Social sciences

f.       Humanities and the arts.

**206.27 GERD by sector of performance**

**206.32 GERD per capita**

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per inhabitant.

**206.33 GERD per researcher**

Total intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per researcher.

**206.34 Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD)**

It encompass all spending allocations met from sources of government revenue foreseen within the budget, such as taxation. Spending allocations by extra-budgetary government entities are only within the scope to the extent that their funds are allocated through the budgetary process. Likewise, R&D financing by public corporations is outside the scope of GBARD statistics, as it is based on funds raised within the market and outside the budgetary process. Only in the exceptional case of budgetary provisions for R&D to be carried out or distributed from public corporations should this be counted as part of GBARD.

**206.35 Government expenditure on R&D (GOVERD)**

It represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Government sector (see the definition of Government sector). It is the measure of expenditures on intramural R&D within the Government sector during a specific reference period.

Government sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Government sector consists of the following groups of resident institutional units

a.         All units of central (federal), regional (state) or local (municipal) government, including social security funds, except those units that provide higher education services or fit the description of higher education institutions (see the definition of Higher education sector).

b.        All non-market NPIs that are controlled by government units that are not part of the Higher education sector.

c.         This sector does not include public corporations, even when all the equity of such corporations is owned by government units. Public enterprises are included in the Business enterprise sector.

**206.36 Government tax relief for R&D expenditures (GTARD)**

It describes tax relief provisions that apply to taxpayers strictly as a result of their engagement in R&D performance and/or funding activities, relative to a normal or baseline tax structure.

**206.37 Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD)**  

It is total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period.

**206.38 Gross national expenditure on R&D (GNERD)**

It comprises total expenditure on R&D financed by a country’s institutions regardless of where the R&D is performed. As such, it includes R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by national institutions or residents; it excludes R&D performed within a country that is funded from institutions outside of the national territory (that is, from institutions that are part of the “rest of the world”). GNERD is constructed by adding the domestically financed intramural expenditures of each performing sector plus the R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by domestic funding sectors.

**206.39 Grossed up results**

Results of the survey extrapolated to the whole target population. Sample survey data represent units in the sample only. Therefore, the sample estimates need to be inflated to represent the whole population of interest. Estimation is the means by which this inflation occurs, also referred to as “grossing up”. Hampering factors for innovation activities Innovation activity may be hampered by a number of factors. There may be reasons for not starting innovation activities at all; there may be factors that slow innovation activities or affect them negatively. These hampering factors include: economic factors, such as high costs or lack of demand; enterprise factors, such as lack of skilled personnel or knowledge; and legal factors, such as regulations or tax rules. Two indicators are calculated:

a.    the percentage of innovation-active firms for which hampering factors were highly important and

b.    the percentage of non-innovative firms for which hampering factors were highly important.

**206.40 Headcount (HC) of R&D personne**l 

The total number of individuals contributing to intramural R&D, at the level of a statistical unit or at an aggregate level, during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year). That means headcount data reflect the total number of persons who are mainly or partially employed in R&D. The use of HCs is mostly recommended in terms of exploring, usually in percentage terms, the characteristics of R&D personnel.

**206.41 Higher education expenditure on R&D (HERD)**

Represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Higher education sector (see the definition of Higher education sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Higher education sector during a specific period.

Higher education sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Higher education sector comprises:

**206.44 Innovation**

Implementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, or a new marketing method, or a new organizational method. The minimum requirement for an innovation is that the product, process, marketing method or organizational method must be new (or significantly improved in the case of product or process) to the firm.

**206.45 Innovation activities**

All scientific, technological, organizational, financial, and commercial steps which actually lead, or are intended to lead, to the implementation of innovations. Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include R&D that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.

**206.46 Innovation-active firms**

Firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period of the innovation survey, including those with ongoing and abandoned activities. In other words, firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period, regardless of whether the activity resulted in the implementation of an innovation, are innovation-active. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.

**206.47 Innovative firms**

Are firms that implemented an innovation. Unless otherwise specified, the term is used to refer to product or process innovative firms, which are also known as product or process innovators. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.

**206.48 Internal R&D funds** are the amount of money spent on R&D that originate within the control of and are used for R&D at the discretion of a reporting statistical unit. Internal R&D funds do not include R&D funds received from other statistical units explicitly for intramural R&D.

**206.49 Internal R&D personnel** are persons employed by the statistical unit who contribute to the unit’s intramural R&D activities.

**206.50 Intramural R&D expenditures**  are all current expenditures plus gross fixed capital expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit during a specific reference period, whatever the source of funds. Intramural R&D expenditure is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a statistical unit. The aggregation of intramural R&D for all units within a sector is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a sector of the economy; the summation of intramural R&D for all sectors is synonymous with the performance of R&D for the entire economy (GERD).

**206.51 Labour costs (in current R&D expenditures)** Labour costs, or compensation of employed personnel, comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated costs or fringe benefits, such as bonus payments, stock options, holiday pay, contributions to pension funds. The concept of labour costs also includes other social security payments and payroll taxes.

**206.52 Land and buildings (in capital R&D expenditures)** include land acquired for R&D use (e.g. testing grounds, sites for laboratories and pilot plants) and buildings constructed or purchased for R&D use, including major improvements, modifications and repairs.

**206.53 Level of formal qualification (for R&D data)** The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) provides the basis for classifying R&D personnel by formal qualification. Five classes are recommended for the purposes of R&D statistics. They are defined exclusively by level of education, regardless of the field in which personnel are qualified.

a.         Doctoral or equivalent level: Programmes at ISCED level 8, or doctoral or equivalent level, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.

b.        Master’s or equivalent level: Programmes at level, or Master’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.

c.         Bachelor’s or equivalent level: Programmes level, Bachelor’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions. First degree programmes at this level typically have a duration of three to four years of full-time study at the tertiary level.

d.        Short-cycle tertiary education: Programmes at level, or short-cycle tertiary education, are often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Typically, they are practically based, occupationally-specific and prepare students to enter the labour market. However, these programmes may also provide a pathway to other tertiary education programmes.

e.         This includes post-secondary non-tertiary education, upper secondary education and below. Post-secondary non-tertiary education: Post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning and educational activities building on secondary education preparing for both labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It typically targets students who have completed upper secondary but who want to increase their opportunities either to enter the labour market or to progress to tertiary education. Programmes are often not significantly more advanced than those at upper secondary as they typically serve to broaden rather than deepen knowledge, skills and competencies. It therefore aims at learning below the high level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education. Upper secondary education: Programmes at this level, or ‘upper secondary’ education, are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Programmes at this level offer students more varied, specialised and in-depth instruction than programmes at lower secondary education. They are more differentiated, with an increased range of options and streams available.

**206.54 Machinery and equipment (in capital R&D expenditures)** cover major (i.e. capitalised) machinery and equipment acquired for use in the performance of R&D.

**206.55 Market introduction of innovations** Activities for the market introduction of product innovations, including market research, market tests and launch advertising.

Examples are water and fuel (including gas and electricity); books, journals, reference materials, subscriptions to libraries, scientific societies, etc.; imputed or actual costs of small prototypes or models made outside the statistical unit; and materials for laboratories (e.g. chemicals, animals, etc.). Other current costs include royalties or licences for the use of patents and other intellectual property rights, the lease of capital goods (machinery and equipment, etc.) and the rental of buildings to support R&D performed by the statistical unit in the reference year. The category of other current R&D costs also includes costs for computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for one year or less; costs associated with engaging persons such as on-site consultants who are not employed in the statistical unit but provide direct services that are integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities; cost for doctoral and master’s students not employed by the statistical unit (e.g. receiving research grant or scholarship tracked by or through the statistical unit); administrative and other overhead costs, i.e. office, information and telecommunications, utilities, insurance, and costs for indirect or ancillary services, i.e. storage; the use, cleaning, repair and maintenance of buildings and equipment; computer services; and the printing of R&D reports.

**206.66 Other intellectual property products (in capital R&D expenditures)** These are costs for purchased patents, long-term licences or other intangible assets used in R&D, and which are in use for more than one year. Other intangibles that can be reported in a unit’s internal financial accounts, such as marketing assets or goodwill, should not be included.

**206.67 Other preparations for product and process innovations**

This includes other internal activities related to the development and implementation of product and process innovations that are not included in R&D. They include development activities that are either partially excluded as R&D (such as industrial design, engineering and set-up, and trial production) or fully excluded (such as patent and licence work, production start-up, and testing), and development activities for product or process innovations that do not meet the novelty requirement for R&D (i.e., they are new to the firm but not new to the market).

**206.68 Other supporting staff**

This includes skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects.

**206.69 Other supporting staff by sector of employment**

Skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects, broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).

**206.70 Performers of R&D**

This consists of statistical units that undertake (i.e. perform) R&D in each of the main sectors covered: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit.

**206.71 Preparations for marketing innovations**

Activities related to the development and implementation of new marketing methods not previously used by a firm. They include the development and planning of new marketing methods and the work involved in their implementation. Activities related to marketing innovations include only those for developing and implementing new marketing methods, not expenditures for using these methods in daily business. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment, and other capital goods and training that are specifically related to marketing innovations.

**206.72 Preparations for organizational innovations**

Activities related to the development and planning of new organizational methods and the work involved in their implementation. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment and other capital goods and training activities that are specifically related to organizational innovations.

Firms that implemented product innovation as well as process innovation.

**206.81 Public general university funds (GUF) (for R&D data)**

The R&D funding share coming from the general grant universities receive from the central government (federal) ministry of education or the corresponding provincial (state) or local (municipal) authorities in support of their overall research/teaching activities.

**206.82 Purchasing power parity (PPP)**

Currency exchange rate that equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies. This means that a given sum of money, when converted into US dollars at the PPP exchange rate (PPP dollars), will buy the same basket of goods and services in all countries. In other words, PPP is the rate of currency conversion which eliminates the differences in price levels among countries. Thus, comparisons between countries reflect only differences in the volume of goods and services purchased.

**206.83 R&D coefficients**

This is a tool for calculating / estimating the shares of personnel and expenditure data attributable to R&D. They are especially used for distributing total resources among research, teaching and other activities (including administration) in the Higher education sector.

R&D functions classification of personnel d according to their R&D function, which may be researcher, technician or other support staff.

**206.84 R&D personnel by sex** 

These are researchers, technicians and equivalent staff, and other supporting staff, broken down by sex (male and female).

**206.85 Research and experimental development (R&D)**

The creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research and experimental development. For an activity to be an R&D activity, it must satisfy five core criteria. The activity must be:

a.    Novel (to be aimed at new findings)

b.    Creative (to be based on original, not obvious, concepts and hypotheses)

c.    Uncertain (to be uncertain about the final outcome)

d.    Systematic (to be planned and budgeted)

e.    Transferable and/or reproducible (to lead to results that could be possibly reproduced).

**206.98 Source of R&D funds** 

This is the unit that provides the funds for R&D performance. Sources may be internal or external to the reporting unit. In surveys and data presentation, external sources are grouped by main sector and relevant subsectors. In broad terms, there are five main sources for R&D funding: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education, Private non-profit and the Rest of the world.

**206.99 Sources of information for innovation activities**

sources that provided information for new innovation projects or contributed to the completion of existing innovation projects. They provide access to knowledge without the need to pay for the knowledge itself, although there may be marginal fees for access (membership in trade associations, attendance at conferences, subscriptions to journals). Open information sources do not provide access to knowledge embodied in machinery or equipment or the right to use knowledge protected by patents and other forms of intellectual property, although the knowledge behind the patent can be accessed through patent databases. Some open sources, such as attendance at fairs or exhibitions, can give access to some tacit knowledge through personal interaction with other participants.

**206.100 Successful innovation activities**

These are activities of a firm that resulted in the implementation of an innovation (though not necessarily commercially successful).

**206.101 Technicians and equivalent staff** 

These are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, the physical and life sciences, or the social sciences, humanities and the arts. They participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the application of concepts, operational methods and the use of research equipment, normally under the supervision of researchers.

**206.102 Time-use surveys (for R&D data)**

This is a statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary information for estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.

**206.103 Total R&D personnel**

in a statistical unit, these include all persons engaged directly in R&D, whether employed by the statistical unit or external contributors fully integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities, as well as those providing direct services for the R&D activities (such as R&D managers, administrators, technicians and clerical staff). Persons providing indirect support and ancillary services, such as canteen, maintenance, administrative and security staff, should be excluded, even though their wages and salaries are included as an overhead cost when measuring R&D expenditure. Two main groups of individuals who potentially contribute to the R&D activities can be identified in a statistical unit: ‘Internal R&D personnel’ and ‘external R&D personnel’. Both groups of R&D personnel are classified according to their R&D function: ‘Researchers’, ‘technicians’ and ‘other supporting staff’. (See the relevant definitions in this glossary).

**206.104 Training for innovative activities**

These are all the training (including external training) that is required for the development or implementation of product or process innovations.

**206.105 Transfer R&D funds** 

These are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit to perform R&D that does not require any good or service in return and where the funder is not entitled to any significant rights on the outcome of the R&D it has funded. The unit that provides transfer funds for R&D may impose some conditions on the performer, such as periodic reporting, compliance with the activity or project description as agreed in the terms of the agreement, or even public dissemination of research outcomes. Examples of transfer funds include grants, debt forgiveness, philanthropy, crowd-funding and personal transfers such as gifts and GUF (by convention for international comparisons). To be included as R&D transfer funds, the funds should be intended by the originating source to be used for R&D. Normally, the R&D performer will retain most rights to the outcomes of the R&D, which explains the transfer nature of this R&D funding transaction.

**206.106 Types of costs of R&D**

Include individual current and capital cost categories for intramural R&D. Types of current costs include labour costs for internal R&D personnel and other current costs (for external R&D personnel, purchases of services, purchases of materials, and other costs not elsewhere classified. Types of capital costs include land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products.

**206.107 Types of R&D**

Three types of R&D are considered under the term ‘R&D’: basic research, applied research and experimental development.

**206.108** T**ypes of R&D funds**

These are the funds to cover the costs of R&D involving significant flows between units, sectors and countries. From the perspective of performance, R&D is conducted by the statistical unit with funds either from the statistical unit’s own sources (internal) or from sources outside of the statistical unit (external). From the perspective of funding, R&D funds pay for either the costs of R&D performance within the statistical unit (intramural) or the costs of R&D performance outside of the statistical unit (extramural). There can be a flow of R&D funds between statistical units either with (exchange) or without (transfer) compensatory return flows of R&D from the performer. See the relevant definitions (on ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sources of R&D funds, ‘intramural’ and ‘extramural’ R&D, and ‘exchange’ and ‘transfer’ categories of funds for R&D) in this glossary.

## 503 Gender Statistics 

Gender statistics refer to statistics that adequately reflect differences and inequalities between women and men in all areas of life. Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:

-  Sex-disaggregated data;

-  Data pertaining specifically to women or men;

-  Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.

**503.1 Gender**  

Gender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.

**503.2 Sex**

Sex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.

**503.3 Gender Analysis**

Gender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.

**503.4 Gender Relations**

These are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.

**503.5 Gender Issues**

Gender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women’s issues.

**503.6 Gender-Aware Planning**

This is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.

**503.7 Gender Inequality**

Gender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.

**503.8 Gender Statistics**

Gender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.

**503.9 Sex-Disaggregated Data**

Data categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.

**503.10 Gender-Disaggregated Data**

Data that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.

**503.11 Statistics on Women**

Data focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.

**503.12 Gender Bias**

Bias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.

**503.13 Gender Stereotyping**

Assigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.

**503.14 Gender Equality**

The condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.

**503.18 Gender Disparities**

Statistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.

**503.19 Gender Parity**

Gender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”

**503.20 Gender Parity Index**

The Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.

**503.21 Gender Development Index (GDI)**

The GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:

1.    Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;

2.    Education – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;

3.    Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.

**503.22 Gender Blindness**

Gender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.

**503.23 Gender Roles**

Gender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.

**503.24 Gender Norms**

Gender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.

**503.25 Gender Planning**

Gender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.

**503.26 Strategic Gender Needs**

These are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.

**503.27 Gender Relations**

Gender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.

**503.28 Gender Balance**

Gender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.

**503.29 Gender Accommodating**

It’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.

**503.30 Gender Perspective**

Taking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.

**503.31 Gender Mainstreaming**

Gender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.

**503.32 Gender Mainstreaming in Statistics**

This involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.

**503.35 Gender-Based Violence (GBV)**

An umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.

**503.36 Women’s Issues**

These refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.

**503.37 Women in Development (WID)**

The WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.

**503.38 Empowerment**

Refers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women's empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.

**503.39 Women’s Economic Empowerment**

Refers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making.

Stateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.

**504.4 Stateless Population, *In Situ***

This refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.

**504.5 Indigenous Peoples**

Indigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.

According to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.

**504.13 Youth**

There is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.

**504.14 Person of Concern**

This term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.

## 505 Living Conditions and Poverty

Living conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term 'living conditions' is closely related to that of 'quality of life.

Poverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.

**505.1 Welfare Analysis**

Welfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.

**505.2 Poverty**

Poverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one's economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.

**505.3 Household Expenditure**

Household expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.

**505.6 Data Used in Analysis**

Data used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.

**505.7 Recall Period**

The recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.

In an interview about household income, the recall period might be "the last month" or "the past year," and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.

**505.8 -Day Recall Period**

Recall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

**505.9 1-Month Recall Period**

**505.11 1-Year Recall Period**

Recall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.

**505.12 Nominal Consumption Aggregate (NCA)**

The computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).

**505.13 Modes of Acquisition**

All surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\
 a) Purchases;\
 b) Household’s own production; and\
 c) Received in kind/gifts, etc.

**505.14 Household’s Own Production**

Food from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.

Food received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.

**505.16 Food Away from Home**

“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.

**505.17 Non-Food Non-Durable Items**

The non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).

**505.19 Hedonic Rent Imputation – Housing Component of the NCA**

Hedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.

**505.20 Adjusting for Price Variation**

Adjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.

**505.21 Adjusting for Household Size and Composition**

This refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.

**505.28 Hardcore (Extreme) Poverty**

Individuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in "hardcore poverty."

**505.29 The Headcount Ratio (HCR or P~0~)/Headcount Ratio (H)**

The proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.

**505.30 Poverty Gap (P~1~)**

The poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.

**505.31 Squared Poverty Gap/Severity of Poverty**

This index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.

**505.32 The Gini Index**

The Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).

**505.33 Multidimensional Poverty**

A measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards.

The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.

**506.5 Climate Prediction**

A probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes.

**506.6 Climate Projection**

The simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning such future developments.

Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).

**507.7 Small Area Estimation**

Small area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.

**507.8 Model-Based Small Area Estimates**

Model-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data. In the context of small area estimates of poverty under unit-level models, the dependent variable is typically consumption, expenditure, or income, and the method relies on properly replicating the welfare distribution.

**507.9 Area-Level Models**
